# Title: Hotel Reservation Cancellation Prediction

# Objective:
The objective of this task is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict hotel reservation cancellations. The rise of online hotel reservation channels has significantly influenced customer behavior and booking possibilities. However, cancellations or no-shows pose a challenge to hotels as they can lead to revenue loss and operational inefficiencies. By predicting cancellations in advance, hotels can optimize their revenue management strategies and minimize the impact of cancellations.

# Dataset:
To train the model, a dataset containing historical hotel reservation data is utilized. The dataset includes various features such as booking date, check-in date, room type, customer information, and previous cancellation records. Each reservation instance is labeled as either canceled (label '1') or not canceled (label '0'). Then booking status is identified through it.

# Data Preprocessing:
The data undergoes preprocessing to ensure its suitability for machine learning algorithms. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features. Additionally, feature engineering techniques may be applied to extract relevant information, such as calculating the lead time between booking and check-in dates or creating customer segmentation based on previous cancellation behavior.

# Feature Selection:
Feature selection techniques are employed to identify the most informative features for predicting reservation cancellations. This helps reduce dimensionality and improve model performance. Techniques such as correlation analysis, recursive feature elimination, or information gain can be utilized to select the most relevant features.

# Model Training and Evaluation:
Various machine learning algorithms can be employed for the task, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting methods. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with the model trained on the training set. Hyperparameter tuning techniques, such as grid search or random search, can be applied to optimize model performance. The trained model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation can be employed to assess the model's robustness.

# Benefits and Impact:
By accurately predicting hotel reservation cancellations, hotels can take proactive measures to optimize revenue management. This includes implementing dynamic pricing strategies, overbooking adjustments, or targeted marketing campaigns to fill canceled rooms. This not only minimizes revenue loss but also improves operational efficiency and enhances overall guest satisfaction.
